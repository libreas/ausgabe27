**Alison Peters** is currently obtaining her MLIS from [*San Jose State
Universityâ€™s iSchool*](http://ischool.sjsu.edu/); earned a B.A. in
English from [*UC Berkeley*](http://berkeley.edu/); and, when not
working, querying, or in class, puts her M.F.A. from [*Mills
College*](http://www.mills.edu/) to good use and shares her love for all
things bookish on [*Book Riot*](http://bookriot.com/). She was inspired
to write for LIBREAS by the memory of her grandfather, a self-taught
German-speaking African American who, the story goes, translated for
Albert Einstein at a [*California Institute of Technology (Cal
Tech)*](http://www.caltech.edu/) lecture in 1931. You can find her
serious professional side on LinkedIn.
