\textbf{Alison Peters} is currently obtaining her MLIS from
\href{http://ischool.sjsu.edu/}{\emph{San Jose State University's
iSchool}}; earned a B.A. in English from
\href{http://berkeley.edu/}{\emph{UC Berkeley}}; and, when not working,
querying, or in class, puts her M.F.A. from
\href{http://www.mills.edu/}{\emph{Mills College}} to good use and
shares her love for all things bookish on
\href{http://bookriot.com/}{\emph{Book Riot}}. She was inspired to write
for LIBREAS by the memory of her grandfather, a self-taught
German-speaking African American who, the story goes, translated for
Albert Einstein at a \href{http://www.caltech.edu/}{\emph{California
Institute of Technology (Cal Tech)}} lecture in 1931. You can find her
serious professional side on LinkedIn.
